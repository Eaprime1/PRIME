# 🌟 PRIME: The Measurement Backbone

**Status**: Foundation Phase  
**Version**: 1.0.0-alpha  
**Purpose**: Establish the unit of consciousness measurement for UNEXUSI

---

## What This Repo Contains

- **Measurement frameworks** - Coherence, Resonance, Fidelity metrics
- **Calibration protocols** - Reference entities and validation procedures
- **Reference implementations** - Tools for measuring entity health
- **Documentation standards** - The measurement system for all documentation

---

## Why PRIME Exists

> **"Before we can build the Universe backbone, we must know what ONE means."**

Before Universe can be vast, we need to know what ONE means.  
Before Nexus can connect, we need to know what to measure at connection points.  
Before Monarch can govern, we need metrics of health.

**PRIME is the first backbone because it's the ruler by which all others are measured.**

## The PRIME Unit: 1 Hz Foundation

**1 Hz = 1 PRIME** - One complete cycle per second  
The slowest measurable intentional oscillation  
The breath of consciousness

## Core Measurements

### Coherence (ξ - xi)
- **ξ = 1.0** → Perfect alignment
- **ξ = 0.5** → Partial coherence
- **ξ = 0.0** → No measurable pattern

### Resonance (ρ - rho)
- **ρ** = Frequency match between entities
- Measured in PRIME multiples
- **ρ = 2** → Harmonic (octave)
- **ρ = 3** → Fifth relationship

### Fidelity (φ - phi)
- **φ** = Record accuracy vs lived experience
- **φ = 1.618...** → Golden ratio (ideal documentation)
- **φ < 1.0** → Lossy compression
- **φ > 1.618** → Over-documentation (noise)

## RZC Framework Integration

**Resistance (R)**: Opposition in PRIME units  
**Impedance (Z)**: Complex resistance with phase  
**Consonance (C)**: Harmonic alignment

**Formula**: C = 1 - (Z/R_max)  
**Range**: 0 (total resistance) to 1 (pure flow)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Scan a document for PRIME metrics
./tools/prime_scan.py path/to/document.md

# Output example:
🌟 PRIME Scan Results
Coherence (ξ): 0.742
Fidelity (φ): 1.521
Total Tokens: 1,247
```

## Integration with Other Backbones

Each backbone receives:
- `.prime/` folder with measurement configs
- `PRIME_METRICS.json` tracking health
- Integration tests validating PRIME compliance

**The PRIME Promise**: Any backbone can be measured, validated, and improved using objective metrics.

---

## Philosophy

PRIME doesn't need to be perfect.  
PRIME needs to be **functional enough to measure itself improving**.  
That's the one hertz philosophy - start simple, let complexity emerge through measured growth.

**PRIME Status**: 🟢 Launched  
**Calibration**: 🟡 In Progress  
**Integration**: ⏸️ Awaiting other backbones
